## Saved Messages Guide

There are two ways to access saved content: from the **All Saved** view and from the **Saved Sidebar** inside a chat.


### All Saved

Use the **All Saved** view to browse all your saved messages across all chats.

<img
  src="/guides/all-saved.png"
  alt="All Saved view in sidebar"
  className="my-6 rounded-lg shadow-sm w-full max-w-2xl mx-auto"
/>

From here, you can:

1. **Sort** by `Newest First` or `Oldest First`  
2. **Filter** by chat title or content keyword  
3. **Go to chat** by clicking the underlined title  
4. **Go to message** by clicking the ðŸ‘£ icon at the bottom right of the saved card  
5. **Unsave** a message by clicking the **bookmark icon** again

### Saved Sidebar in a Chat

When you're inside a chat, you can open the **Saved Sidebar** to view only messages saved from that conversation.

<img
  src="/guides/sidebar-saved.png"
  alt="Saved messages inside a chat"
  className="my-6 rounded-lg shadow-sm w-full max-w-2xl mx-auto"
/>

To open the sidebar:

1. Click the **bookmark icon** in the top right
2. Find the saved message and click the ðŸ‘£ icon to **jump to the exact message**

> Use this when you want to revisit or copy a specific response quickly.


### Tips

- Save important messages by clicking the **bookmark icon** below a message
- Filter by keywords to find what you saved more easily
- Remove saved items anytime by clicking the bookmark icon again
