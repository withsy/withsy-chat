## Usage Limits

Withsy is currently a **completely free service**, and to keep it that way while ensuring fair and stable access for everyone, we’ve put in place some usage limits.


### Daily Chat Limit

To help manage server resources and ensure smooth performance for everyone, each user can send up to:

- **30 messages per day**

> This limit resets every 24 hours at midnight (UTC).  
> If you reach the limit, a notification will appear — and you’ll be able to resume chatting the next day.


### AI Profile Image & Name Customization

You can personalize your AI models with a **friendly name** and a **custom profile image**.

- **Image requirements**:
  - Must be under **1MB**
  - Accepted formats: `.jpg`, `.png`, `.webp`
- **Name limit**: Up to **20 characters**
- You can **delete your custom image at any time** and revert to the default.


### Monthly Profile Image Update Limit

To keep things fair and stable, we allow:

- **Up to 10 profile image changes per month**

> The counter resets automatically on the 1st day of each month (UTC).  
> You can still remove or clear your profile image at any time — this doesn't count toward the limit unless you're uploading a new one.


We may adjust these limits in the future based on usage patterns and service sustainability.  
Thanks for being part of Withsy!
