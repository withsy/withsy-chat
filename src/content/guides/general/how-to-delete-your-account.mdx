## Account Deletion Guide

We're currently building a feature that will let you delete your account directly from our website. Until then, you can request account deletion via email.

### Request Deletion via Email

To permanently delete your account and all associated data:

1. Send an email to [withsy.team@gmail.com](mailto:withsy.team@gmail.com)  
2. Use the **email address linked to your Withsy account**  
3. Include the subject line: **Account Deletion Request**

We’ll verify your email and process the deletion as soon as possible.

> Most requests are handled within **2 to 3 business days**.  
> If you don’t receive a response after 3 business days, we may have missed your message — feel free to follow up.

### In-Site Deletion Coming Soon

Soon, you’ll be able to delete your account directly from the site without sending an email. We’ll update this guide when the feature is live.
